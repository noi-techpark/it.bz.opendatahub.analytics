## Local development

Run the application inside the `src/main/webapp` folder with `python3 -m
http.server 8999` and then check `localhost:8999` for results. Make sure to use
the port `8999`, if you want to test authentication with our Keycloak test
server, since the callback has been set to `localhost:8999`.

## Docker environment (optional)

For the project a Docker environment is already prepared and ready to use with all necessary prerequisites.

These Docker containers are the same as used by the continuous integration servers.

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally on your machine.

### Start and stop the containers

Before start working you have to start the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

After finished working you can stop the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Running commands inside the container

When the containers are running, you can execute any command inside the
environment. Just replace the dots `...` in the following example with the
command you wish to execute:

```bash
docker-compose exec app /bin/bash -c "..."
```

### Map style
Default map style uses openstreetmap. To use the
[Thunderforest](https://www.thunderforest.com) map style, you can add your
Thunderforest API key to the configuration file in src/main/webapp/config.js
